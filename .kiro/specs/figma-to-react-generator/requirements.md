# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) Figma-to-React code generator that transforms Figma designs into functional React components using the Figma API and Google's Gemini LLM API. The application allows users to input a Figma project file URL and API token, then generates visually similar React code within Gemini's 8k token limit. The generated code can be downloaded as a complete project package ready for immediate development use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input my Figma project URL and API token so that I can generate React code from my designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for Figma project URL and API token
2. WHEN the user enters valid Figma credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the connection to Figma API
3. IF the Figma credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
4. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL enable the code generation process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to fetch and process my Figma design data so that it can be converted to React components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates code generation THEN the system SHALL fetch design data from Figma API
2. WHEN processing Figma data THEN the system SHALL extract component hierarchy, styles, and layout information
3. WHEN processing design elements THEN the system SHALL optimize data to fit within 8k token limits
4. IF the design data exceeds token limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently prioritize and compress information
5. WHEN data processing is complete THEN the system SHALL prepare structured input for the LLM

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate React code that visually matches my Figma design as closely as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending data to Gemini API THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive design specifications
2. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL create React components with appropriate styling
3. WHEN processing layouts THEN the system SHALL preserve visual hierarchy and positioning
4. WHEN handling colors and typography THEN the system SHALL maintain design consistency
5. WHEN generating responsive elements THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate CSS techniques
6. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview the generated code and see how it looks before downloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated React code in a scrollable viewer
2. WHEN viewing code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for better readability
3. WHEN code is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow full vertical scrolling through all generated content
4. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL show a visual preview of the generated component if possible
5. WHEN code is ready THEN the system SHALL enable the download functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download a complete, runnable React project so that I can immediately start development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks download THEN the system SHALL generate a complete project structure
2. WHEN creating the download package THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies in package.json
3. WHEN packaging files THEN the system SHALL include src directory with generated components
4. WHEN creating the project THEN the system SHALL include configuration files (vite.config.js, etc.)
5. WHEN download is complete THEN the user SHALL be able to run npm install and npm run dev successfully
6. WHEN the project runs THEN the generated components SHALL render correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust API integration so that the system handles errors gracefully and provides good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
2. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and suggestions
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and error messages
4. WHEN processing large designs THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
5. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain theme harmony and follow best practices so that it's professional and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing components THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices and patterns
2. WHEN styling the application THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual theme
3. WHEN structuring code THEN the system SHALL use proper separation of concerns
4. WHEN handling state THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate state management
5. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL include proper error boundaries and loading states
6. WHEN creating the UI THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design and accessibility
